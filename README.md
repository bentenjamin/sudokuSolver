Sudoku Solver

Had a challenge with some friends to write a 9x9 sudoku solver in pure c with no libraries (this is in accordance with the french school 42's "norme" standard). This is the rough working result. It took 1 hour 57 minutes and 38 seconds from first line to working.

usage:
gcc *.c -o sudoku
./sudoku line0 line1 line2 line3 line4 line5 line6 line7 line8
